## Overview

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), as one of the most renowned tech companies in the world, popular for developing the Windows Operating System, is looking to dive into the industry of film creation. This project aims to provide guiding insights to Microsoft as it begins its content creation journey by analyzing popular Box Office films from other large companies. This analysis mainly focuses on the genre, runtime, rating and, the producing studio of films that perform best at box Office.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is planning to launch a new movie studio but **lacks insight** into what types of films are most successful in today's market. By analyzing data on box office performance, genres, production studios and audience ratings, **we aim to identify trends that can guide Microsoft's content creation strategy and maximize both domestic and international success**.

## Data

The data files provide the title of the film, year of creation of the film, the average rating of the film as well as other attributes of the film (e.g. film runtime, domestic and international profits). The data used in the analysis has films that have been produced from 2010-2018. Every film associated with the analysis has a unique title name as its unique attribute.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of popular films produced to identify useful trends that can guide Microsoft's content creation and maximize their success in the industry.
