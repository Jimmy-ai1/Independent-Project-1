# Microsoft Film Creation Strategies Analysis

**Author**: Jimmy Chege Gichui

## Overview

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), as one of the most renowned tech companies in the world, popular for developing the Windows Operating System, is looking to dive into the industry of film creation. This project aims to provide guiding insights to Microsoft as it begins its content creation journey by analyzing popular Box Office films from other large companies. This analysis mainly focuses on the genre, runtime, rating and, the producing studio of films that perform best at box Office.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is planning to launch a new movie studio but **lacks insight** into what types of films are most successful in today's market. By analyzing data on box office performance, genres, production studios and audience ratings, **we aim to identify trends that can guide Microsoft's content creation strategy and maximize both domestic and international success**.

## Data

The data files provide the title of the film, year of creation of the film, the average rating of the film as well as other attributes of the film (e.g. film runtime, domestic and international profits). The data used in the analysis has films that have been produced from 2010-2018. Every film associated with the analysis has a unique title name as its unique attribute.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of popular films produced to identify useful trends that can guide Microsoft's content creation and maximize their success in the industry.

## Results

**Action, Adventure and Comedy** are the top three revenue-generating genres. This indicates that they have **broad audience appeal and string market performance.**

Films with a moderate to long runtime **(between 100 to 150 minutes)** tend to generate higher box office returns. Extremely short or overly long films show reduced returns.

Films with **average ratings between 6.0 and 8.0** tend to perform better financially. There's a moderate positive correlation between audience approval and revenue which means that other factors like genre, marketing etc also heavily influence box office success.

The total box office returns have shown a **fluctuating trend** over the years. There were significant spikes in 2011 and 2013, while 2012 and 2014 experienced noticeable declines.
The average runtime of films has **generally increased over time**, following a sharp drop in 2011. An exception to this trend occurred in 2018, where runtime saw a significant decline compared to 2017 - This suggests a gradual shift toward longer storytelling formats, although shorter films have gained popularity in 2018.

## Conclusions

- **Action, Adventure and Comedy films** lead in total box offic gross, proving to be the most commercially successful genres.
- Films with runtimes between **100 to 150 minutes** tend to perform better financially as they strike a balance between depth and watchability.
- **Temporal trends** - Total returns fluctuate year by year with notable spikes and dips. Runtime has generally increased over time, with a few outiliers
- Genres with high audience appeal such as Drama and Documentary tend to have lower gross, while popular genres like Action perform better at box office level despite their lower average ratings.


## Recommendations

This analysis leads to five recommendations for Microsoft's content creation journey:
- **Start with films with Action, Adventure and Comedy**, which have a high global market appeal to maximize returns.
- **Prioritize films with strong reception potential.** Aim to produce films with an average rating of 7.0+ as they are most likely to yield high results.
- **Target Runtimes between 100 to 150 minutes**, where box office performance and viewer engagement tend to be optimal.
- **Balance Quality and Popularity**. Consider including occasional critically driven content such as Drama and Documentary films to brand credibility.
- **Stay responsive to trends**. Keep track of year-by-year trends in genre performance, runtime norms and viewer preference to stay competitive and agile.
